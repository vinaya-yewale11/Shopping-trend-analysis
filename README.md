Project Description: Shopping Trends Analysis

Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping trends using a dataset that includes demographics, purchase behavior, and transaction details. 
The goal is to identify key insights that help businesses optimize marketing strategies, pricing, and product offerings.

Methodology:
Data Collection: The dataset contains customer details such as age, gender, purchase history, discount usage, payment method, and more.
Data Preprocessing:
Converted categorical values like "Yes/No" to Boolean.
Categorized review ratings into meaningful groups (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Age Distribution: Identifies the dominant age groups among shoppers.
Impact of Discounts: Determines whether discounts influence total purchase amounts.
Seasonal Trends: Analyzes spending variations across different seasons.
Gender-Based Spending: Compares purchase behavior between male and female customers.

Discounts impact shopping behavior but donâ€™t always lead to higher spending.
Seasonal variations play a crucial role in customer spending patterns.
Credit cards and digital wallets are the most preferred payment methods.
Subscription status influences the average purchase amount.

Business Implications:
